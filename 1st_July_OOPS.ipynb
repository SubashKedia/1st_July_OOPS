    "\n",
    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a class. It is a runtime entity that combines data (attributes) and behaviors (methods/functions) into a single entity. In simpler terms, an object is a tangible or conceptual entity that can be manipulated and interacted with in a Python program.\n",

    "5. What is the difference between class variables and instance variables in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, class variables and instance variables are two types of attributes that can be defined within a class. The main differences between them are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Scope and Accessibility:\n",
    "   - Class variables: Class variables are shared among all instances of a class. They are defined at the class level, outside any methods. Class variables can be accessed and modified by all instances of the class as well as within class methods. They have a single copy that is shared across all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Instance variables: Instance variables are specific to each instance of a class. They are defined within methods, typically the constructor (`__init__` method), using the `self` keyword. Instance variables are unique to each object and can have different values for each instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization and Assignment:\n",
    "   - Class variables: Class variables are typically defined and assigned a value directly within the class definition. They are initialized once and retain their value across all instances of the class. Any modifications to class variables are visible to all instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Instance variables: Instance variables are initialized and assigned values within instance methods, usually in the constructor (`__init__` method). Each instance can have different values for instance variables, as they are specific to that particular object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accessing and Modifying:\n",
    "   - Class variables: Class variables can be accessed using the class name itself or any instance of the class. When accessed via an instance, the value is retrieved from the class. Class variables can also be modified using the class name or any instance, affecting all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Instance variables: Instance variables are accessed and modified using the `self` keyword within instance methods. Each instance has its own copy of instance variables, and modifications made to them are specific to that instance only.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that if an instance variable has the same name as a class variable, the instance variable takes precedence within that instance. Changes made to the class variable will not affect the instance variable with the same name."

    "6. What is the purpose of the self parameter in Python class methods?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the self parameter is a convention used in class methods to refer to the instance of the class itself. It acts as a reference to the object on which the method is being called. The self parameter is typically the first parameter in instance methods and is automatically passed when the method is invoked on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of the self parameter is to access and manipulate the instance variables and other attributes of the object within the method. By using self, you can refer to the specific instance of the class and perform operations on its data. It allows you to differentiate between instance variables of different objects and access them within the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter is a naming convention, and you can choose any name for the first parameter of instance methods. However, it is recommended to use self to maintain consistency and improve code readability, as it is widely recognized by Python developers as the standard name for the instance reference."
